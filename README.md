Kernel Source Code for Lenovo A3500-FL

run "./kernel.sh" to compile kernel & create a working boot.img package.

Be sure to change paths inside "kernel.sh" & "pack_bootimage.sh", otherwise you'll get compiling errors.

Stock Ramdisk & Stock Sources are used, nothing has been modified.

You'll obtain a boot package working exactly as the built-in one.
